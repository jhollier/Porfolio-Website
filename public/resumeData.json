    "bio": "After several years of physically building anything from racecars to rocket engines, I became obsessed with building using software technologies â€“ I have the global pandemic lockdown to thank for this. I enjoyed building personal software projects so much that I expanded my career towards using those same technologies to adress deficiencies and automate out laborious tasks at my current job.",
